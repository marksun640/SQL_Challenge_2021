Description

'It's easier to train them than it is to train you' is the quote I remember. The person speaking was a director
of information technology for the Minneapolis Police Department. The 'you' he was referring to was the
general public. 'Them' referred to a bank of clerical workers, over which we were looking while having
a conversation. I was in secondary school in a suburb of Minneapolis, and was enrolled in a mentorship
program with the Minneapolis Police Department. The quote was in response to a question I asked: why did
the police department hire clerical staff to take and enter reports from citizens, rather than allow citizens to
directly enter the data themselves on the (then-emerging) World Wide Web?

The Director went on to explain that data quality is very important in analytics. When the general public
entered data directly into city information systems, the quality of the data was poor. Specifically, it was rife
with misspellings, which made reporting on crime very difficult. For example, different reports might list the
address as '1600 Pennslyvaina Ave', '1600 Pennsylvianaia Ave', and '1600 Pennylvania Ave'. Our reporting
tools at the time would show these 3 crimes under 3 different locations, when in fact they all occurred at
the same place!

For several afternoons each week during my senior year of high scool, I worked on refining algorithms to
better recognize misspelled addresses in order to produce more accurate visualizations of crime data. I
modeled this challenge on that task in hopes that you can experiment in one week with techniques that took
me nearly one whole academic year to implement!
